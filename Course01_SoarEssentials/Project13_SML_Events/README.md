# Project 13 - Soar Markup Language (SML) Event Handlers

## New Concepts

* Using event listeners
* Calling CLI commands from code
* Stopping Soar from code



## Problem

* Our app requires a very deterministic behavioral flow from our agent.
    * But Soar shines best when it is dynamic and interactive!


## Solution

* Use event listeners to enable dynamic interactivity with the Soar agent.


## Instructions: Lesson and Project

1. Open the lesson here. (_under construction_)
    * If you are comfortable with Python, everything you need to know should be clear from the comments in the instructor solution files. Read through them and see how the final project code works!
1. As you go through the lesson, open each project file for editing when it is called for: 
    * [code_starter.py](./code_starter.py)
    * [funcs_starter.py](./funcs_starter.py)
    * [io_starter.py](./io_starter.py)
1. When you've finished this project, you are done with this course! Congratulations!
