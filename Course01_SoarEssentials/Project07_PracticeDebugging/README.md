# Project 7 - Practice Debugging

## New Concepts

* Copying down superstate WMEs for efficiency
* Nested condition conjunctions within rules
* Debugging with matches -w
* LHS conjunctions and disjunctions


## Problem

* We have a substate set up,
    * But our agent doesnâ€™t yet use it to sort suppliers with complex reasoning.
    * We still sort only by total-score.
* We also don't have much experience using debugging commands to inspect our code when things go wrong.


## Solution

* Use substate operators to:
    * Iterate over attribute weights given on the input-link
        * In descending order
    * For each weight, sort suppliers by their attribute scores for that weight.
* Get practice using the `matches -w` command for rule debugging!
