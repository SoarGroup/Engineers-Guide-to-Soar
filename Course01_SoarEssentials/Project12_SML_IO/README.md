# Project 12 - Soar Markup Language (SML) I/O Management

## New Concepts

* Using custom input classes
* Looping over output WMEs


## Problem

* The approach we've used so far for I/O would be tedious to code with large amounts of input.


## Solution

* Use custom input object classes to cleanly and quickly generate large collections of input.
