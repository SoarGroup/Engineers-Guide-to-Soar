# Project 9 - Combining Preferences

## New Concepts

* Using the "reject" (-) preference
* Using the "soar init" command to reset an agent


## Problem

* Our agent is supposed to filter input suppliers before sorting by weighted scores.
* Our agent is supposed to limit the number of recommendations it gives.
* Our agent can only handle a single round in input/output.


## Solution

* Use preferences to add the needed behavior.
* Learn how to reset our agent after it sends output.
* Finish our Supplier Sorting agent Soar code!
