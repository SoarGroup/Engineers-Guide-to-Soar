# Project 3 - Operator Basics

## New Concepts

* Soar Operators
    * The Decision Cycle
    * Propose Rules
    * Preference Rules
    * Apply Rules
* Stateful Actions
* Negative Conditions

## Problem

* Our agent detects input elements, but it does not yet do anything with them.


## Solution

* Use operators to have the agent choose suppliers from its input.
    * Use an operator proposal rule to propose an operator for each input supplier that the agent detects.
    * Use an operator preference rule to have the agent choose them in a particular order.
    * Use an operator apply rule to print a message for each selected supplier in the order it is selected.
