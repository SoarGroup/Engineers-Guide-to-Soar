# Project 11 - Soar Markup Language (SML) WME Management

## New Concepts

* Opening a linked debugger from code
* Removing input WMEs properly


## Problem

* We can add WMEs to Soar's input-link, but we don't know how to remove them!
* We therefore don't know how to give an agent new work after it finishes a task.
* It is also tedious to manually link a Soar Debugger to an agent we create from code.


## Solution

* Make a Python-based app environment that both adds and removes WMEs.
* Run the Soar agent multiple times with different inputs.
* Spawn a Soar Debugger from our app code that is automatically connected to our agent.
