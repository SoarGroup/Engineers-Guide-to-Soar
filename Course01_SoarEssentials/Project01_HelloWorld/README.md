# Project 1 - Hello World

## New Concepts

* Basics of using Soar
    * The Soar CLI
    * Soar Productions/Rules
    * Soar Working Memory (WM)
* Soar rule syntax
    * Conditions
        * The default "`^type`" Working Memory Element (WME)
    * Actions
        * The `(write)` and `(crlf)` RHS functions


## Problem

* Our agent has not yet told the world, "hello". This is an egregious breach of etiquette. If we do not rectify this impropriety, the world might grow to become most seriously irate.

## Solution

* Make a basic Soar rule that fires once to say "hello" to the world!
