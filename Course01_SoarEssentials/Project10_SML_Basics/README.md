# Project 10 - Soar Markup Language (SML) Basics

## New Concepts

* Communicating with Soar using SML
* SML Identifier and WME classes
* Basic agent creation, I/O, and shutdown


## Problem

* We have been relying on rule-simulated input to run our agent!


## Solution

* Make a Python-based app environment that runs our agent and manages I/O to/from the agent.
